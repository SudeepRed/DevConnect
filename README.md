# DevConnect
## The Problem!
When developing a product, developers often need feedback from their customers and other devs.

The most effective way to to get this feedback is to have communities on slack, discord, github or reddit.

But the problem comes when the small team of developers is bombarded with issues, bugs, feedbacks, questions, chats, feature requests and much more during the development phase.

## The Solution

Now time for developers is very important, and it is impossible to go through each message and classify them manually.

This is where DevConnect helps the developers.

DevConnect automatically classifies **messages** from **slack** and **issues** from **github** into **bugs** or **feature** **requests** and assigns them a **priority** so that developers can choose to work on the **important** tasks.

Q: And where does it show the classified tasks……..? 


A: **VSCode** -  where the developer spends most of his time developing his product.
